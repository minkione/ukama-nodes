##Transmitter test case procedure
1.	Set the BS as per the test setup as per the setup diagram shown above.
2.	Start with 10MHz channel bandwidth for Top, Middle and Bottom channel frequency.
3.	Configure the board TRX switching by enabling TX mode (by making TRX_SWIT_CNTRL High)
4.	Run the command “./dl_pltd.sh 1 0001 1.1 2” to transmit signal according to ETM 1.1 test model.
5.	Measure the mean output power from spectrum analyzer.

Run the scipi command to measure the Mean output power from spectrum analyzer 
Commands need to update
6.	Repeat the above test steps for Middle and Bottom channel frequencies.
7.	Repeat the above test steps for the Antenna port 1.
8.	Ensure the test results (power level, ACLR, SEM) is as per the test requirement as per expected.
9.	SEM test case setup need to update.
