###Clock/Reset Overview

####Clock tree

Several clock sources are used in TRX module to cater for clock requirements of the system. Below diagram represents the clock architecture used in TRX module:

Oscillators are used as core clock reference for CNF7130, Ethernet switch and Clock generator IC. 
A 12MHz crystal is used as USB reference clock for CNF7130
In order to support timing requirement of AD9363, an OCXO,U7769LF is used from Rakon. This can be tuned via an analog signal at control voltage input pin. Analog voltage is generated by using a DAC(DAC8571) controlled from CNF7130

####Reset tree

Reset architecture used in TRX module is as shown below:
